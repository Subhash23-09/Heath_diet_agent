# Arogya Wellness Orchestrator

**Arogya Wellness Orchestrator** is a full-stack, multi-agent health and wellness assistant.  
The backend (Flask + LangChain + Google Gemini) coordinates specialized agents for symptoms, lifestyle, diet, and fitness, then synthesizes a **safe wellness plan**.  
The frontend (React + Vite) provides a guided experience for login, profile management, wellness queries, and follow-up questions.

## Core Features

### Multi-Agent Wellness Pipeline
- **Symptom Triage Agent** – identifies general wellness concerns (non-diagnostic)
- **Lifestyle Guidance Agent** – sleep, routine, stress-related advice
- **Diet & Nutrition Agent** – food and hydration guidance (with simple RAG context)
- **Fitness & Activity Agent** – low-intensity, safety-first movement suggestions

### Shared Conversational Memory
- Short-term memory shared between agents during orchestration
- Ensures agents are context-aware of each other’s outputs

###  Structured Orchestration Output
The orchestrator combines all agent outputs into a single structured JSON response:
- `synthesized_guidance` – markdown wellness plan with:
  - Overview  
  - When to See a Doctor  
  - Lifestyle & Rest  
  - Hydration & Diet  
  - Hygiene & Environment  
  - Movement & Activity  
  - Final Note
- `recommendations` – concise bullet-point takeaways
- Raw agent outputs:
  - `symptom_analysis`
  - `lifestyle`
  - `diet`
  - `fitness`

###  Follow-up Q&A
- Users can ask follow-up questions after receiving a wellness plan
- Backend uses the **last stored plan + recommendations** as context
- Ensures continuity and safer responses

### Frontend Experience
- Username/password login (demo JSON-based store)
- Profile management:
  - height
  - weight
  - medications
- Wellness dashboard:
  - Full wellness plan or **recommendations-only** view
  - Optional **Agent Communication View**
  - Markdown-rendered summaries
  - Follow-up questions panel
- Shared navbar & branding: **Arogya Wellness Orchestrator**
