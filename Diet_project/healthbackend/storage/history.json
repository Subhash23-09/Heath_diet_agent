Try to finish heavy meals at least 2-3 hours before bedtime.\n4.  **Elevate Head (If Comfortable & Advised):** For some individuals, sleeping with the head slightly elevated (e.g., with an extra pillow or a wedge pillow) can help with breathing. **Discuss this with your doctor first.**\n5.  **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Wind down with calming activities like reading, gentle stretching, or a warm bath (if comfortable) in the hour leading up to sleep.\n\n### Stress Management\n\n1.  **Gentle Breathing Exercises (If Cleared):** If your doctor approves and you feel comfortable, practice very gentle, slow, diaphragmatic breathing exercises.

      "diet": "As a dietician, I must first and foremost echo the critical advice from the lifestyle agent: **difficulty breathing is a serious symptom that requires immediate medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.**\n\nThe following dietary guidance is general and aims to support overall well-being. **It is absolutely crucial that you consult with your doctor or a registered dietitian before making any significant changes to your diet, especially while experiencing a serious symptom like difficulty breathing.** This advice is not a replacement for personalized medical or dietary consultation.\n\n---\n\n### General Dietary Principles (Once Medically Cleared)\n\nWhen dealing with a serious symptom like difficulty breathing, the focus should be on easily digestible, nutrient-dense foods that support overall health without causing additional strain or discomfort.\n\n1.  **Prioritize Nutrient Density:** Choose foods that provide a lot of nutrients for their calorie content.\n2.  **Smaller, More Frequent Meals:** Instead of 3 large meals, consider 5-6 smaller meals throughout the day. This can be easier to digest and may prevent feelings of fullness that can sometimes exacerbate breathing discomfort.\n3.  **Stay Well-Hydrated:** As mentioned by the lifestyle agent, adequate hydration is vital. Water, herbal teas, and clear broths are excellent choices.\n4.  **Focus on Whole Foods:** Emphasize unprocessed or minimally processed foods.\n\n### Foods to Prefer (Once Medically Cleared)\n\n*   **Lean Proteins:**\n    *   **Skinless poultry:** Chicken breast, turkey.\n    *   **Fish:** Especially fatty fish rich in omega-3s like salmon, mackerel, sardines (if tolerated), or leaner white fish like cod, tilapia.\n    *   **Legumes:** Lentils, beans, chickpeas (if they don't cause bloating or gas).\n    *   **Tofu/Tempeh:** Plant-based protein sources.\n    *   **Eggs:** A versatile and easily digestible protein.\n*   **Fruits:**\n    *   **Berries:** Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries (rich in antioxidants).\n    *   **Apples, Pears:** Good source of fiber.\n    *   **Bananas:** Easy to digest and provide potassium.\n    *   **Citrus fruits:** Oranges, grapefruits (if no medication interactions).\n    *   **Melons:** Watermelon, cantaloupe (hydrating).\n*   **Vegetables:**\n    *   **Leafy Greens:** Spinach, kale, collard greens (steamed or lightly cooked for easier digestion).\n    *   **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (cook thoroughly to aid digestion; if they cause gas, limit them).\n    *   **Root Vegetables:** Carrots, sweet potatoes, squash (baked, boiled, or roasted).\n    *   **Bell Peppers, Tomatoes:** Rich in vitamins.\n*   **Whole Grains:**\n    *   **Oats:** Oatmeal (plain, unsweetened).\n    *   **Brown Rice, Quinoa:** Easily digestible complex carbohydrates.\n    *   **Whole Wheat Bread/Pasta:** In moderation, if tolerated.\n*   **Healthy Fats:**\n    *   **Avocado:** Monounsaturated fats.\n    *   **Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds (in moderation, as they can be heavy).\n    *   **Olive Oil:** For cooking and dressings.\n*   **Soups and Broths:** Clear, low-sodium vegetable or chicken broths can be very soothing and hydrating, especially if appetite is low. Creamy soups can be made with vegetable purees and low-fat milk/broth.\n\n### Foods to Limit or Avoid (Once Medically Cleared)\n\n*   **Highly Processed Foods:** Fast food, pre-packaged meals, most frozen dinners, processed snacks (chips, cookies).

These offer little nutritional value and can contribute to inflammation.\n*   **Unhealthy Fats:** Deep-fried foods, excessive amounts of fatty meats, trans fats (found in some processed baked goods and margarines).\n*   **High-Sodium Foods:** Canned soups, processed meats, many restaurant meals. Excess sodium can contribute to fluid retention.\n*   **Carbonated Beverages:** Sodas, sparkling water (for some, these can cause bloating and gas, which might put pressure on the diaphragm and worsen breathing discomfort).\n*   **Very Spicy Foods:** Can sometimes cause heartburn or discomfort.\n*   **Alcohol:** As mentioned by the lifestyle agent, alcohol can interfere with sleep and overall bodily functions.\n*   **Caffeine:** Limit or avoid, especially close to bedtime, as it can disrupt sleep and potentially increase anxiety.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Pay close attention to how different foods make you feel. If a food causes discomfort, bloating, or worsens your symptoms, avoid it.\n*   **Cooking Methods:** Opt for baking, grilling, steaming, or roasting over deep-frying.\n*   **Portion Control:** Even healthy foods should be consumed in appropriate portions.\n\n---\n\nThis general dietary advice is intended to support overall health and well-being. **Given the serious symptom of difficulty breathing, your absolute priority should be to seek immediate medical attention and follow the advice of your healthcare provider.** Any dietary changes should only be implemented after consulting with your doctor or a registered dietitian who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific medical condition and needs.",

Focus on a relaxed pace, almost a stroll.\n    *   **Focus:** Pay attention to your breath. If you notice any increase in breathlessness, slow down or stop.\n    *   **Caution:** This is not about getting your heart rate up; it's about gentle movement. If 2-5 minutes feels like too much, do less or none at all.\n\n2.  **Seated Gentle Stretches:**\n    *   **How:** While seated comfortably, perform very slow and gentle stretches for your neck, shoulders, and upper back.\n        *   **Neck Tilts:** Gently tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 10-15 seconds. Repeat on the other side.\n        *   **Shoulder Rolls:** Slowly roll your shoulders forward a few times, then backward a few times.\n        *   **Gentle Arm Reaches:** Slowly reach one arm overhead, then the other, without straining.\n    *   **Focus:** Move within a comfortable range of motion.

Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly rise. Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your belly fall.\n    *   **Focus:** The goal is to breathe deeply using your diaphragm, not your chest. This can be very calming.\n    *   **Caution:** Only attempt this if your doctor has specifically recommended breathing exercises. If it causes any discomfort or makes breathing harder, stop immediately.\n\n### Crucial Safety Guidelines:\n\n*   **STOP IMMEDIATELY:** If you experience *any* pain, discomfort, increased breathlessness, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest tightness, or unusual fatigue, stop the activity at once.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is paramount. Your body will give you signals. Do not push through any discomfort.\n*   **No Heavy Lifting or Strenuous Activity:** Absolutely avoid anything that makes you strain, hold your breath, or significantly increases your heart rate or breathing effort.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink water throughout the day, as advised by the diet and lifestyle agents.\n*   **Rest is Key:** Allow your body ample time to rest and recover.\n\n**Again, please prioritize seeing a doctor for your difficulty breathing.

      "lifestyle": "Given the symptom of **difficulty breathing**, my primary and most urgent recommendation remains:\n\n**You must seek immediate medical attention from a healthcare professional.**\n\nDifficulty breathing is a serious symptom that requires a medical diagnosis to understand its cause. Lifestyle changes are not a substitute for medical evaluation and treatment in this situation.\n\n**It is unsafe and inappropriate to suggest lifestyle changes or constraints without a medical diagnosis for difficulty breathing.** Doing so could delay necessary treatment or provide advice that is unhelpful or even harmful depending on the underlying cause.\n\nOnce a medical professional has diagnosed the cause of the difficulty breathing and prescribed a treatment plan, they will be able to advise on appropriate lifestyle adjustments. These might include:\n\n*   **Specific exercise recommendations:** Tailored to the individual's condition and capacity.\n*   **Dietary changes:** If related to conditions like heart disease, allergies, or obesity.\n*   **Environmental modifications:** Such as avoiding allergens or irritants if asthma or allergies are a factor.\n*   **Stress management techniques:** If stress or anxiety contribute to breathing difficulties (e.g., panic attacks), but only after ruling out physical causes.\n*   **Smoking cessation:** If smoking is a contributing factor.\n\n**Please prioritize seeing a doctor immediately.** They are the only ones who can safely and effectively guide you on how to manage this symptom and any subsequent lifestyle adjustments.",
      "diet": "Given the symptom of **difficulty breathing**, my most important advice, echoing the lifestyle agent, is that **you must seek immediate medical attention from a healthcare professional.** Difficulty breathing is a serious symptom that requires a medical diagnosis to understand its cause.\n\nAs a dietician, I cannot provide a specific diet plan tailored to \"difficulty breathing\" without a medical diagnosis. Doing so would be irresponsible, as the underlying cause could range from allergies to heart conditions, lung issues, or other serious health concerns, each potentially requiring different dietary considerations. A general diet plan might not be appropriate or could even be counterproductive depending on your specific medical situation.\n\n**Therefore, my primary recommendation is to consult with a doctor immediately.** Once a medical professional has diagnosed the cause of your difficulty breathing and prescribed a treatment plan, they can then advise on any specific dietary adjustments that might be beneficial for your condition. They may also refer you to a registered dietitian who can create a personalized plan based on your medical needs.\n\nIn the meantime, for general health and well-being, and **not as a treatment for difficulty breathing**, here are some universally healthy eating principles:\n\n**General Healthy Eating Principles (Not a treatment for difficulty breathing):**\n\n*   **Focus on Whole Foods:** Prioritize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, unless advised otherwise by a doctor for a specific medical condition.\n*   **Balanced Meals:** Aim for meals that include a variety of food groups to ensure you get a broad spectrum of nutrients.\n\n**Foods to Generally Prefer (for overall health, not for breathing issues):**\n\n*   **Fruits and Vegetables:** A wide variety of colorful options.\n*   **Whole Grains:** Oats, brown rice, quinoa, whole-wheat bread.\n*   **Lean Proteins:** Chicken, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, eggs.\n*   **Healthy Fats:** Avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil.\n\n**Foods to Generally Limit or Avoid (for overall health, not for breathing issues):**\n\n*   **Highly Processed Foods:** Snacks, fast food, sugary drinks, processed meats.\n*   **Excessive Added Sugars:** Found in many processed foods, desserts, and sweetened beverages.\n*   **Excessive Saturated and Trans Fats:** Often found in fried foods, baked goods, and some processed snacks.\n*   **Excessive Sodium:** High levels can be found in processed foods, canned goods, and restaurant meals.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** This general dietary advice is for overall health and is **not a replacement for medical advice or a personalized diet plan from a registered dietitian or doctor.** It is crucial that you address your difficulty breathing with a healthcare professional immediately to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
      "fitness": "Given the critical symptom of **difficulty breathing**, my most urgent and important recommendation, aligning with the advice from the previous agents, is that **you must seek immediate medical attention from a healthcare professional.**\n\nDifficulty breathing is a serious symptom that requires a medical diagnosis to understand its cause. As a cautious fitness coach, my priority is your safety. Recommending any physical activity, even low-intensity, without a medical evaluation for difficulty breathing would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous.\n\n**It is unsafe and inappropriate to suggest any physical activity until a doctor has diagnosed the cause of your difficulty breathing and provided specific guidance on what, if any, activity is safe for you.** Engaging in physical activity with an undiagnosed breathing issue could worsen your condition or pose significant health risks.\n\nOnce a medical professional has evaluated your condition, provided a diagnosis, and cleared you for physical activity, they will be able to advise on appropriate types and intensities of exercise. They may also refer you to a physical therapist or a specialized exercise program.\n\n**Please prioritize seeing a doctor immediately.** Your health and safety are paramount.",
      "synthesized_guidance": "The overarching and most critical guidance from all agents (symptom, lifestyle, diet, and fitness) is that **difficulty breathing is a serious symptom requiring immediate medical attention from a healthcare professional.** All agents unequivocally state that it is unsafe and irresponsible to provide specific lifestyle, dietary, or fitness recommendations without a medical diagnosis for this condition. Doing so could delay necessary treatment, be ineffective, or even harmful depending on the underlying cause.\n\nOnce a medical professional has diagnosed the cause of the difficulty breathing and prescribed a treatment plan, they will be able to advise on appropriate lifestyle adjustments, dietary changes, and safe physical activities. They may also refer to specialists such as a registered dietitian or a physical therapist for personalized guidance.\n\nWhile general healthy eating principles are mentioned for overall well-being (focusing on whole foods, hydration, balanced meals, and limiting processed foods, added sugars, unhealthy fats, and excessive sodium), these are explicitly stated as **not a treatment for difficulty breathing** and should not be pursued as a substitute for medical evaluation. Similarly, no fitness recommendations are provided due to the severity and undiagnosed nature of the symptom.",
